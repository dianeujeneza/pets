      <strong><em>A pet</em></strong> or companion animal is an animal kept
      primarily for a person's company, entertainment, or as an act of
      compassion such as taking in and protecting a hungry stray cat, rather
      than as a working animal, livestock, or laboratory animal.

      <strong>Budgies.</strong> One of the most popular pet bird species in the
      world are budgies, which you may know as parakeets. ... On top of being
      small and easy to care for, budgies take well to training and can learn to
      perform many fun bird tricks.
    </p>
    <h3>Temperament</h3>
    <p>
      Budgies are
      <em
        >jovial little birds that love to play and explore their
        surroundings.</em
      >
      While they look forward to time spent with their human companions, hey can
      be quite independent making them perfect for novice bird owners.
    </p>
    <h3>Colors</h3>
    <p>
      In the wild, Budgies are striped green and yellow, with dark green flight
      feathers that appear almost black.
    </p>
    <h3>Feeding</h3>
    <p>
      While many commercial budgie diets consist of only seeds, they alone do
      not provide adequate nutrition for pet birds. Most veterinarians recommend
      that budgies are placed on a diet of a variety of vegetables. They should
      also be fed a formulated pelleted diet as they contain important vitamins
      and nutrients and can be fortified with additional supplements.
    </p>
    <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>
      Budgies are active little birds and need exercise every day to keep
      themselves in top shape. Captive budgies, particularly those that live in
      small cages, should be allowed out for at least a couple of hours daily in
      a secure area so they can explore and stretch their wings.
