    <p>Budgies. One of the most popular pet bird species in the world are budgies, 
        which you may know as parakeets. ... On top of being small and easy to care for, 
        budgies take well to training and can learn to perform many fun bird tricks.
    </p>
    <h3>Temperament</h3>
    <p>Budgies are jovial little birds that love to play and explore their surroundings. 
        While they look forward to time spent with their human companions, 
        hey can be quite independent making them perfect for novice bird owners.</p>
    <h3>Colors</h3>
    <p>In the wild, Budgies are striped green and yellow, with dark green flight feathers that appear almost black.</p>
    <h3>Feeding</h3>
    <p>While many commercial budgie diets consist of only seeds, they alone do not provide adequate nutrition for pet birds. 
        Most veterinarians recommend that budgies are placed on a diet of a variety of vegetables. 
        They should also be fed a formulated pelleted diet as they contain important vitamins and nutrients
         and can be fortified with additional supplements.</p>
    <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>Budgies are active little birds and need exercise every day to keep themselves in top shape. Captive budgies, 
        particularly those that live in small cages, should be allowed out for at least a couple of hours daily in a secure area so 
        they can explore and stretch their wings.</p>
